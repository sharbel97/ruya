# ruya
 
Ruya is a Computer Vision project geared towards autonomous vehicles software. "Ruya" in Arabic means *vision*. The goal of this project is to make a 3D vector-space of objects surrounding a vehicle using a simple camera system (multiple 2D cameras connected around a vehicle, using software algorithms, we can make high confidence conclusion about the surrounding real world in 3D) rather than using expensive LiDAR technology.
